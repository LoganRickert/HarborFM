# Security

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in HarborFM, please report it privately so we can address it before it is disclosed publicly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

## Reporting

Email **security@harborfm.com** with:

- A description of the issue and how it might be exploited
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Any suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

We will acknowledge your report and will do our best to respond in a reasonable time. We may follow up for more details.

## Scope

We are interested in vulnerabilities in HarborFM itself (server, web app, or deployment/config we ship). Issues in third-party dependencies should be reported to the respective project; we still appreciate a heads-up at security@harborfm.com so we can track and upgrade as needed.

Thank you for helping keep HarborFM and its users safe.
